          <p>We need dark in order to show light. Anything you want to do you can do here. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

This is unplanned it really just happens. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Learn when to stop. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.

Fluff that up. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Let all these things just sort of happen. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.

Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Mountains are so simple, they're hard. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important.

Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. We have a fantastic little sky! Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.

We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. And maybe, maybe, maybe...

We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
